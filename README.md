## Key Features

- List, search and download your products.
- Manage multiple accounts at once.

## Product download

To start download, just press the `Download` button. You don't need to decompress or run extractors. The `dlsite-manager` will handle other tedious jobs for you!

> **NOTE**: Download path can be configured via `Setting > Open Settings` menu.

## Renew product list

The products are cached on your machine, so newly purchased things will not be shown. To refresh it, click the menu `Product > Fetch New Products`.

> **NOTE**: If you want to drop caches and update products entirely, click the menu `Product > Refresh All Products (Drop Caches)` instead.

## Managing not-owned products

You can manage products that are not owned by any account! Use `Product > Scan Downloaded Products` to scan all downloaded products at once. It can also be used to restore download state of your products, too!
